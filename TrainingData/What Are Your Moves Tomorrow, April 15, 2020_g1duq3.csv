"Ok, so apparently a lot of you don‚Äôt know about thinkorswim cash accounts? 

Thinkorswim cash accounts (most cash accounts except fucking Robinhood) give you unlimited day trades until your buying power reaches 0. For example, if you perform a day trade and make $500 return in a account with $1,000. You can‚Äôt use the $500 to day trade until the next day. However, you can still use the other funds   ($1,000) in your account to day trade as much as possible. All the funds you make from day trade will have to be settled until next day to be reused again for day trading. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the 3 day trade limit or anything. 

Create a thinkorswim cash account. Margin must be disabled. Enable options. Speak with customer service to make sure you have cash account tier 2. 

If you still need help setting it up, just PM me or google around. 

It helps you with getting more day trades AND prevents you from over trading.",10,fnfnbuv

"Unfortunately, many bulls gonna lose their asset this week because I am seeing the same trend I saw back when Tesla mooned to $1000ish. More and more people getting greedy and stocks are moving exponentially, which does not make sense. I think there won't be any more short squeeze and there won't be such huge jump starting now. Only thang availble is QE from Mr Pow Jay. This QE injection is done in very linear fashion, just slowly increasing the uptrend support day by day. All these nonsense ups were from the short squeezes. We are almost the top and the second fall is imminent. Think about it. QE amount is decreasing everyday and there is no such thing called unlimited QE.
